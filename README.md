# Description:
  This project was deployed as a part of a homework assignment where we were asked to create a solution that can let users access and update their employee database. 

# Instructions:
  First we created a sql file containing the database template and another sql file that contained the information that goes inside the database. 
  Then we created and worked our logic inside a javascript file that will let us perform a certain tasks with the help of mysql query. 

  To run this program we will need to install basic modules and packages such as 
  ``` 
  npm init -y
  npm install inuqirer
  npm install mysql
  npm install console.table
  ```

  These are essential for running the program.
